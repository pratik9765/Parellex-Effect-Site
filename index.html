            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">
                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.
                Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
                scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create
                psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can
                only be obtained by such activities.
                <br> <br>
                Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g.
                fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.
                According to adventurer André Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his
                life, where is his dignity?"

                <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your
                lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.
                If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.
                You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a
                stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
                <br> <br>
                Because biking is a low-impact exercise, it’s ideal if you have arthritis in your hips, knees, and
                ankles or you’re recovering from a joint injury. Plus, it helps build stronger leg muscles, providing
                more support for your joints, which lessens pain.
                If you have back problems, it’s fine to include biking in your routine, but you need to find another
                form of working out that strengthens your core and makes you more flexible.

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by
                the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br> <br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
                By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a
                few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also
                be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in
                wave pools.
                <br> <br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
